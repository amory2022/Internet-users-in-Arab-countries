# Internet-users-in-Arab-countries
A data analysis project for the number of Internet users in the Arab countries We got the data 
from the Kaggel website (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanuprabhu/list-of-countries-by-number-of-internet-users) ,
and then we converted the data file format from CSV format to Exelworkbook format, and after that we browsed the data 
and then evaluated the cleaning procedures, first we checked whether there are duplicate values ​​or not, and then we performed the sorting 
and filtering procedures, to sort the Arab countries from the rest of the world, And then we formatted the numbers and texts, 
Then we made pivot tables to extract and organize the data, Then we created the appropriate visualizations for each pivot table. 
We then grouped the visualizations into a dashboard to include all the visualizations and inserted a slicer for all the visualizations to interact.
